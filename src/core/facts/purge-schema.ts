/**
 * Purge ledgers and the resurrection guards that read them. One canonical copy
 * used by the schema migration and, through scripts/build-schema.ts FRAGMENTS,
 * by fresh-install DDL.
 *
 * - `fact_purges`: a text-free tombstone per purged claim fingerprint
 *   (gbrain_fact_fingerprint), keyed like `fact_withdrawals`. The facts
 *   guard raises typed `purged_content` for a matching insert or claim
 *   update, whatever its expired_at, so `INSERT ... RETURNING` callers never
 *   see zero rows silently.
 * - `take_purges`: the same tombstone for verbatim take copies; canonical
 *   projections and the takes guard consult it, so a stale takes fence cannot
 *   re-project a purged claim.
 * - `page_purges`: `gbrain delete <slug> --purge` records the purged page's
 *   content hash. A page write whose content hash matches, under any slug,
 *   raises `purged_content`; `gbrain pages unpurge` clears it.
 * - `derivation_inputs`: complete row -> input edges written by every deriver
 *   (`recordDerivationInputs`). Purge walks them transitively to hide derived
 *   rows and mark them `needs_rederive` before cascades delete the evidence.
 * - `needs_rederive`: derived rows a purge hid; a deriver regenerates them from
 *   surviving inputs and deletes the marker.
 *
 * A fingerprint of a short claim is guessable; the ledger proves a claim was
 * purged to someone who already knows it, never what it said.

/**

 * The primary key leads with visibility, so each of those scanned every
 * tombstone of the source (GBRA-69: 4-5 ms per snapshot at 10,000 fact
 * tombstones, about 7 snapshots per import). `fact_purges_subject_idx` serves
 * a page's own tombstones and the lazy '*' lookup by fingerprint;
 * `fact_purges_all_subjects_idx` holds only the '*' rows the marker counts.
 * The import probes that match a fence row against `subject='*' OR
 * subject=slug` (facts/purge-overlay.ts, eligibility/fence-overlay.ts) become
 * a bitmap OR over the pair. Migration v231 builds both (CONCURRENTLY on
