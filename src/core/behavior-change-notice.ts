/**
 * One-time disclosure of the behavior changes an upgrade turns on (safety
 * notice `behavior_changes`, agent operator contract v1). Disclosure only:
 * every change stays on, nothing waits for an answer, and delivery is never
 * recorded as the user's consent.
 *
 * BEHAVIOR_CHANGES is the one table of disclosed changes, each with the
 * release that introduced it:
 *   0.60.68.0  a non-empty `chat_fallback_chain` is walked on every non-pinned
 *              chat call (only when a chain is set; a remote (HTTP) caller
 *              sees only that a chain is configured), managed-brain autopilot
 *              lint writes its repairs, transcript re-ingest makes smaller
 *              parts, the mention linker rebuilds its resume state once.
 *   0.60.74.0  fix wave 9: shell jobs reap leftover processes, the
 *              declaring-pack extract_atoms auto-drain, the 90-day OAuth
 *              access-token cap, the writer-status `local_process_ingress`
 *              rename, `jobs work` exit codes, the longer retention of
 *              unextracted corpus files.
 *   0.60.77.0  quote grounding on by default (think, syntheses, concepts,
 *              patterns); forget's `similar_active` and the TypeSafe-gated
 *              overnight withdrawal review.
 *   0.60.87.0  the save-before-compaction notice in Claude Code and OpenClaw
 *              sessions (core memory ships off, so it is not a change).
 * A release that changes behavior appends its rows; a shipped row's release
 * never changes.
 *
 * Identity: notice id (`behavior_changes@<BEHAVIOR_NOTICE_SINCE>`, the newest
 * row's release, never the running VERSION) × brain × channel, plus the
 * authenticated client on HTTP. A release with no new rows re-notifies
 * nobody. Content: only the rows introduced after the last notice release
 * this brain × channel (× client) was shown, or after the brain's baseline
 * when it was never shown one. The baseline (the first gbrain version that
 * saw it, `0` when it already existed) is recorded once under GBRAIN_HOME:
 * `gbrain init` stamps a database it creates with this version; otherwise
 * the first look decides from the recorded upgrade history
 * (`upgrade-state.json` `from` below the newest row) or the brain's own
 * creation time (its oldest `sources.created_at` more than
 * FRESH_BRAIN_GRACE_MS ago). A fresh install sees no notice.
 *
 * Markers:
 *   - CLI and stdio: one file per notice × brain × channel under
 *     GBRAIN_HOME/notices/behavior-changes/, created exclusively (`wx`), so
 *     concurrent processes deliver it once; the newest marker names the last
 *     release shown. A home that cannot be written still gets the notice
 *     (once per process).
 *   - HTTP: one bounded `config` row in the brain DB
 *     (`notices.behavior_changes.http`: up to HTTP_SHOWN_CAP client ids, each
 *     with the release it was shown, oldest dropped first). No migration: the
 *     row reuses the key/value table every brain has.
 * `gbrain doctor --only behavior_changes` reads every row newer than the
 * brain's baseline again and writes nothing.
