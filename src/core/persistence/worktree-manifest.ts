/**
 * The canonical worktree manifest that writer transfer, rebind (`sources
 * set-path`), clone and reclone compare: a digest over relative path ->
 * sha256 of the file's bytes, plus the file count, with deletions caught by
 * exact path-set equality. Stored manifests carry only the digest, count and
 * scope, so their size does not grow with the worktree.
 *
 * #6099: a Git checkout is hashed in `git` scope, over the paths Git tracks
 * (`git ls-files -z --cached --stage`, hashed from the working-tree bytes; an
 * index entry missing on disk counts as deleted). Ignored files (a `.env.local`,
 * `node_modules`) are never opened, so a clean clone verifies and secrets are
 * never read or hashed. Untracked files Git does not ignore are reported as a
 * count only. A directory that is not the top of its own Git work tree keeps the
 * `tree` scope: every file except `.git`, `.gbrain-managed` and physical-root
 * metadata. A manifest without `scope` is in `tree` scope, which is also what every
 * manifest an older release stored is, so those keep verifying in that scope.
 *
 * Git runs through `hardened-git.ts` (the candidate directory's config is
 * untrusted). Symlinks, submodules (gitlinks) and tracked paths that resolve
 * outside the root (including an index entry with a `..` segment) refuse with
 * `writer_manifest_unsafe` before anything is read.
